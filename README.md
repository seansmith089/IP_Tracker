## IP_Tracker

DESCRIPTION  
IP Tracker created using React, the Leaflet JS Library, and the IPIFY geo-location API

WHY I CREATED THIS PROJECT  
I wanted to create this IP tracker as I used them pretty often when working in IT Support. I hadn't worked with maps in React before, so I was interested to learn something new 

WHAT I LEARNED  
Using the Leaflet library to dynamically display the users current location, as well as that of the users searches
Form validation using Regular Expressions (Regex) - I hadnt used these before, but found them really useful to validate that a users input was either a valid domain name or IP address
